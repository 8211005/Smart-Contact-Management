# Smart Contact Management

## Overview

MyToken is a Solidity smart contract. It extends the functionality of the ERC20 standard token by providing additional features such as minting, burning, and ownership control.

## Features

**Deposit:** Will have a deposit function.

**Withdraw:** Withdraw function is shown.

**Balance:** User will know the balance of the account.

**Get Balance:** Similar to the "Balance"

**Owner:** The adress of the owner
  

## Usage
1. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the `MyToken` contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network, specifying a name, symbol, and initial supply for the token.

2. **Minting:**
   - The contract owner can mint new tokens by calling the `mint` function and specifying the recipient account and the amount of tokens to mint.

3. **Burning:**
   - Token holders can burn their own tokens by calling the `burn` function and specifying the amount of tokens to burn.


## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only trusted entities have access to the contract owner's address to prevent unauthorized minting or manipulation of token supply.
- Review and test the contract thoroughly before deploying it to a production environment to ensure its security and functionality.
